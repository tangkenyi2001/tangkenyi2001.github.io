Hi, this is my first blog post! I created this website to document my career and tech journey and will be sharing about my learnings. I believe it will be fun to look back on!
 
I have gone through a few iterations of portfolio websites, with each one slightly better than the previous one 😊. After trying Docusaurus at my first internship at SAP, I realised
that it was very convenient as it uses markdown files, reducing overhead. I can just focus on the content, allowing me to post more consistently. As of now, I will be sharing my thoughts on the new emerging tech and also how they can be used.
