# Docusaurus
## Why I chose Docusaurus

Using a static site generator like Docusaurus significantly reduces overhead when publishing my content, allowing me to focus on the content instead of having to center a `<div>`. 
I like minimalistic UI, easy to use interface, hence, choosing it was a easy choice.

I first used Docusaurus at my first internship at SAP, where I was tasked to migrate the teams documentation for our Gen AI Platform SDK from MKDocs to Docusaurus. 

Our team opted to use Docusaurus instead of MKDocs as it offered a few advantages. 
1. Default theme is clean, mobile-friendly, and modern. (This was the main reason🤣)
2. Docusaurus supports MDX, which lets you embed React components directly inside your Markdown.
3. Can add interactive demos, live code snippets, charts, or custom widgets easily.
