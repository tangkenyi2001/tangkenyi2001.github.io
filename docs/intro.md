Hey there! Welcome to my world! I’m **Ken Yi**, a final year Computer Engineering undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University, currently exploring software engineering through internships at SAP, PayPal, and Apple. 


This blog is a space for how I think beyond what a resume can show. I spend much of my time outside of work and school experimenting with new tools, building side projects, especially around large language models, distributed systems, and emerging infrastructure.

Here, I share ideas, experiments, and reflections that I think is fun.
